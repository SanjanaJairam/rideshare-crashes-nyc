# Explorer Transportation Data Science Project  
**Analyzing Ride-Share Crash Patterns in Manhattan**

This project was developed as part of the **Explorer Transportation Data Science Project**, hosted by the **Transportation Data Science Program (TDSP)** in collaboration with the **Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub**, the **National Student Data Corps**, and the **U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration**.

---

## ðŸ“Š Project Objective  
To explore how ride-sharing services impact crash patterns in urban environments, with a specific focus on **Manhattan, New York City**. The research emphasizes safety for **vulnerable road users**, including pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists.

---

## Research Question  
**How do ride-sharing services impact crashes involving vulnerable road users in Manhattan?**

---

## Key Findings  

- **Unspecified causes** account for approximately **30%** of ride-share crashes â€” highlighting limitations in reporting.
- **Driver inattention/distraction** is the second leading factor, making up an estimated **20%** of crashes.
- **Improper turning** and **failure to yield** are significant contributors, especially in intersection-dense areas like Manhattan.
- **Fatigue/drowsy driving** is a notable risk factor, possibly linked to ride-share driver schedules.
- **Crash rates peak during commuting and nightlife hours**, indicating high-risk periods for pedestrians and cyclists.
